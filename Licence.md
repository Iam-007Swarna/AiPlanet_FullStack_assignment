Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

## Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software, designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software. It requires that the source code of modified versions running on servers is made available to users interacting with those servers.

## Terms and Conditions

### 0. Definitions

- **"This License"** refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
- **"The Program"** refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
- **"Modify"** means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work.
- **"Covered Work"** means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.
- **"Convey"** means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.

### 1. Source Code

- **"Source code"** means the preferred form of the work for making modifications.
- **"Object code"** means any non-source form of a work.

### 2. Basic Permissions

You have the unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. You may make, run, and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions. Conveying under other circumstances is permitted under the conditions stated below.

### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law

No covered work shall be part of an effective technological measure. You waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License.

### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code, provided that you conspicuously publish an appropriate copyright notice, keep intact all notices stating this License and any non-permissive terms, and give all recipients a copy of this License.

### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions

You may convey a work based on the Program, provided you meet the following conditions:
- The modified work must carry prominent notices stating it has been modified.
- You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.
- If the modified work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices.

### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms

You may convey object code, provided you also convey the Corresponding Source code, or ensure it can be obtained via a network server at no charge.

### 7. Additional Terms

You may place additional permissions or restrictions on the material added by you to a covered work.

### 8. Termination

This License will terminate if you do not comply with its terms. However, if you cease all violations, your license will be reinstated.

### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies

You are not required to accept this License to receive or run a copy of the Program.

### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors to run, modify, and propagate that work, subject to this License.

### 11. Patents

If you convey a covered work, you grant the recipient a patent license to use, sell, and run the work.

### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom

If conditions are imposed on you that contradict this License, you do not excuse yourself from the conditions of this License.

### 13. Use with the GNU General Public License

You may convey a covered work under either this License or the GNU GPL, provided that the requirements of both licenses are met.

### 14. Revised Versions of this License

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License.

### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty

There is no warranty for the Program, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

### 16. Limitation of Liability

In no event unless required by law will any contributor be liable for damages.

### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program.
